        <p> Cricket is a sport which is played between two teams of eleven players each. One team, which is batting,
            tries to score runs , while the other team is fielding, and tries to prevent this. Runs are scored by
            hitting the ball, which is thrown by a player from the fielding team to a player from the batting team,
            across the boundary, or by the batting team's players running between two areas of the field called the
            batsmen's grounds as many times as possible before the fielding team successfully hits a wicket (set of
            sticks) in either of the grounds with the ball to get them out.</p>
